# imageQC_dash
Application to display trendlines and automated results from [imageQCpy](https://github.com/EllenWasbo/imageQCpy/wiki).

The dash part was before v3.2+ of imageQCpy only included in the main program.
Since v3.2 of imageQCpy the dash part is further developed as a standalone to move towards the possibility to publish the trends on intranet.
